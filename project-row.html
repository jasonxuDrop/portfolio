        <p>The ocean is not big enough for two captains. Outlast the other player by throwing fishes to sink their boats or smack them with your oar. </p>

        <p>Made for a 48-hour game-jam (Global Game Jam 2024). As the main programmer I coded the 2D physics, player control, game state logic. Game Jam version available on itch.io, linked below.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl">Features</h2>

        <h3 class="text-2xl">2D physics</h3>

        <p>We wanted this game to have some silly physics: a barely floating boat, a oar that is too heavy to swing sometime, and some silly looking fishes. Most of the physics were using unity's 2D physics, but also some custom modification. </p>

        <p>The oar moving the boat was the part that went through the most tweak, the custom calculation translate the oar's movement to a force which moves the boat in a way that looks natural. </p>

        <p>The oar was done as a joint rigidbody to the player. This also went through various tweaks. We wanted it to be a double edge sword, when it is extended it moves the boat faster and has better reach, but also it shifts the player's center of mass so much that a big moves make it looks like the player is going to fall over. </p>

        <p>The player is also an joint rigidbody connected to the boat. I had to do some hacks to make the player try to stay upright while still looking like a physics object. </p>



        <div class="h-8"></div>

        <h3 class="text-2xl">Fish AI</h3>

        <div class="relative w-full h-0 pb-[56.25%]
        overflow-hidden rounded-2xl">
            <iframe width="1216" height="684" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w4Gp_03ebRw" 
            title="YouTube video player"

            class="absolute w-full h-full top-0 left-0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <p>The fish swims across the ocean from one side to the other. But it can be thrown around, out of the water, and sometimes off the map to Narnia. Made a simple way AI that goes to specific waypoints, so that even if its AI is interrupted by the player it can still resume afterwards.</p>

        <p>Also made object pools for the fishes. Memory management is always good practice no matter the scope üëç</p>

        <p>The wiggle animation is done with a simple 3D animation by me. (#TechArt)</p>



        <div class="h-8"></div>

        <h3 class="text-2xl">Enemy AI</h3>

        <p>I made the character controller that it can take either player 1 input, player 2 input or from an AI. We didn't have time to make it too complex so I made it to row left for a long random duration, then row right for a shorter random duration. </p>

        <p>But as it turned out, that was enough to defeat 80% of the players who tried the game‚Ä¶ We got complains that the AI was too hard‚Ä¶ Sometime I'm scared by my own creations‚Ä¶</p>



        <div class="h-8"></div>

        <h3 class="text-2xl">Game State Logic</h3>

        <p>The win lose conditions. I wrote all that, not much more to say.</p>
