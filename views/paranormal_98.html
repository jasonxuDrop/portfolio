    <p>A hidden object game set in a 1998's brutalist apartment complex. You are an investigator tasked with finding the paranormal entities that have been driving the tenants insane. I worked on this as the lead gameplay programmer.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl">Features for Full Game - <span class="text-2xl handlee-regular">I did these, fr fr, trust :)</span></h2>

    <h3 class="text-2xl">Dialogue System</h3>

    <p>The base of the dialogue system relies on Pixel Crushers' Dialogue System for Unity asset. I've made the custom UI for the dialogue window: status on dialogue option, custom UI, and text animation. I have also expanded the dialogue sequencer to support cinematic integration asked by the designers: set specific object active, trigger More Mountain Feedbacks, animate custom character portrait. </p>

    <div></div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl">Cinematics</h3>

    <p>I integrated multiple interactable cinematic sequences: custom camera movement, tutorial during cinematic, integrating various player actions into cinematics. I ensured the set up is easy to modify at any step to support whatever change that needed to be made down the line because this was a process with many iterations. For example, the tutorial puzzle has 8 states, and a sub system for a specific cinematic event in the middle. </p>

    <div></div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl">Developer Tool</h3>

    <p>Same as the other projects, I made various developer tools for P98. Some are for specific puzzles to skip to different part of the process. Some are for more specific usages both in GUI and in editor. Many component uses Odin Inspector to give developer more accurate runtime information to debug. And also a developer console for to be used at any state of the game.  </p>

    <div></div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl">Save System</h3>

    <p>Using Easy Save 3 asset as a base, there are many objects and data that needs a custom saving solution. Since there were too many single use custom interactions getting everything to save properly in every scenario took a while. But also made many workflow improvement for commonly used components. </p>

    <div></div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl">Graphical Programming</h3>

    <p>Made some custom shaders, and a graphical render feature adding new post-processing volume features. </p>
