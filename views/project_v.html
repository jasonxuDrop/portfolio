    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Project V (under NDA)</h1>

    <p>A rouge-lite, 2.5D, creature-collecting auto battler. In a world roaming with various creatures, tame them all, and create your dream team with maximize synergy. I developed core gameplay features as the primary programmer.</p>

    <p>No publicly released information yet. So I have even less to show for this project. I did pour a big portion of my professional career into this project so really hoping this gets to see the light of day in the future ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl">Features - <span class="text-2xl handlee-regular">I did these, fr fr, trust :)</span></h2>

    <p>Designed and implemented a scalable and modular AI system using a finite state machine architecture.</p>

    <p>Built and maintained over 20 unique modular creatures with runtime behavior logic using reusable modular components. Created internal tools enabling non-programmers to update configuration data in seconds, cutting iteration time by 99% and improving team efficiency.</p>

    <p>Built user interface systems following the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern to ensure separation of concerns and scalable UI architecture.</p>

    <p>Developed custom rendering logic for graphical features.</p>

    <p>Collaborated daily with designers and artists to translate abstract requirements into scalable, technical solutions.</p>
